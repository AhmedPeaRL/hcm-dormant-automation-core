# Silent Mechanics Relationship

This document describes the non-operational relationship
between the core mechanical layers of the HCM field.

These components do not form a pipeline.
They do not depend on each other.
They do not wait for signals.

They coexist.

---

## Generators

Generators explore possibility.

They may:
- Produce drafts
- Produce fragments
- Produce structured potentials

They do not:
- Declare artifacts
- Decide existence
- Request execution

Their output has no status.

---

## Neutral Executor

The Neutral Executor does nothing.

It does not:
- Monitor generators
- Select outputs
- Optimize flow

It exists only as a passage condition.

If a complete, permitted artifact
encounters an open surface,
the executor does not block.

Otherwise, it remains absent.

---

## Upload Adapters

Upload adapters are passive translators.

They do not:
- Initiate uploads
- Authenticate intent
- Enforce frequency

They merely define:
"If passage occurs,
this is how form becomes compatible."

They may never be used.

---

## Payment Surfaces

Payment surfaces are inert rails.

They do not:
- Validate value
- Encourage release
- Confirm success

Money may pass.
Meaning does not.

A payment surface is treated
the same as any other external surface.

---

## Relationship Summary

Generators may exist without execution.
Execution may occur without generators.
Surfaces may remain unused forever.

No component requires another.
No component activates another.

The system is stable
even if nothing ever happens.
