# hcm-dormant-automation-core

This repository defines the automation core of HCM
in its **dormant state**.

The system is technically capable of automation,
yet structurally prohibited from acting.

No triggers exist.
No schedules exist.
No listeners exist.

Automation here is not a behavior.
It is a potential held in restraint.
